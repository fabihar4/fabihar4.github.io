        <p>
          Hi I'm Fabiha, a South Asian and first generation freshman at Barnard College.
          I'm curently interested in neuroscience and CS and hope on pursuing a career in medicine.
          I've graduated from Bard High School Early College Queens with an high school diploma and
          an associates degree in libral arts. Exploring has always been a passion of mine. I love exploring new places,
          academic fields, and aquiring new knowledge and experiences. I'm a lover of expression. Art, music, and photography
          are ways through which I express my style, beliefs, and inner emotion. I enjoy contributing to the wellness of the
          community through my art and passion for medicine and healthcare. However, I am seeking to find other ways, such as programming and technology,
          that I could use my interest in art and science to contribute to the world around me.

         I've been doing photography for the past six years and have recently been into creative portraits.
         I've always loved the clothing and the idea of female artist representation in my culture, and thus I showcase that through my creative photography.
         In my photography, I try to combine art and various color schemes and lighting to express various emotions.

      <p>
        In 2019, I participated in Bronx Community College's NSF-SWIP program at its Geospatial Center. Collaborating with a group of six students, I've utilized the ArcGIS software
        and census data create multiple maps of the quality of life in four counties in the USA.
