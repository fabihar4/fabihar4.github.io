      <h2> A Glimpse Into Some of my Photography </h2>
    </div>
      <p> I've been doing photography for the past six years and have recently been into creative portraits. </p>
      <p> I've always loved the clothing and the idea of female artist representation in my culture, and thus I showcase that through my creative photography. <p>
      <p> In my photography, I try to combine art and various color schemes and lighting to express various emotions. <p>
